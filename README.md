# MyFxApp â€“ Forex Account Progress Tracker

MyFxApp is a multiplatform .NET MAUI application developed as a final project for the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy. It leverages the MyFxBook API to track forex account progress in real time. The app utilizes local SQLite caching (with a 5-minute refresh policy), MVVM architecture, dependency injection, and Microcharts for data visualization.
